# MasterScript
## For dicking around in the Tribehouse

You click the textdisplay boxes that are conveniently placed just above the TFM header in the UI:
- *click type:* will cycle through the different clicks you can use. 
- *teleporting:* will drop down a menu of players in the room, click one to target them for teleporting.
  - Your click type will be set to tp (teleport) when you select a player.
- *spawn:* will give you the option to select an object to spawn with your mouse click.
  - There is also the "enter id/name" option, in which you will be prompted with an input popup: type in the name or the id of an object to select it for spawning.
  - An item limit is in place, it is by default `3` - the Master can change it.
  -  As with teleport, your mouse automatically sets to click type: spawn, which will spawn the object with a mouseclick.
